- Hi, everyone! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m @asistiqlal and Iâ€™ve been having interest towards big data and data science
- Since my background isn't really related to those topics and fields, I took courses and certifications about big data, cloud computing, and data science. But I realize there's no use of learning so much about stuff without put it into work in a form of concrete projects with real results.
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data science projects as a whole or even just partially since it will help me deepen and sharpen my knowledge and skill anyway.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on as.istiqlal.work@gmail.com

Thank you for visiting!
