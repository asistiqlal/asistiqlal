- Hi, everyone! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m @asistiqlal and Iâ€™ve been having a big interest in how to acquire and understand real-world data and then try to find solution(s) for problems related to the data using findings I get from analyzing the data.
- Since my background isn't really related to those topics and fields, I took courses and certifications about big data, data analytics, and data science. But I realize there's no use of learning so much about stuff without put it into work in a form of concrete projects with real results. So here I am, building my repository that acts as my portfolio and also as my record to look back later in the future when I finally make it as a data scientist :)
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data science projects as a whole or even just partially since it will help me deepen and sharpen my knowledge and skill anyway.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on as.istiqlal.work@gmail.com

Thank you for visiting!
